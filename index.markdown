    <h2>The Need</h2>
    <p>Central to our mission of bringing individuals closer to God through His Word is the strength and unity of our own family. As we plan for our family's growth, particularly with our hearts set on foster care and adoption, the need for a reliable and spacious family vehicle has become clear. This is why we're raising $15,000 to purchase a new family minivan. Not only will this vehicle accommodate our growing family, but it will also allow us to maintain a healthy work-life balance, support our mission-related travel needs, and provide a welcoming and safe transportation for any children we are blessed to welcome into our home. Your support in helping us meet this goal plays a direct role in strengthening our family and extending our mission.</p>

    <h2>Why a Minivan?</h2>
    <p>After three years of serving in Hawaii, we are returning to the mainland. As we adapt to this significant change, a reliable family vehicle becomes essential for us to continue our mission. We chose a minivan because it's versatile and practical, making it perfect for our family's needs as we transition back into mainland life. Your generous contribution towards this cause is not just about helping us buy a minivan, it's about supporting us as we continue our journey in faith and service.</p>

    <h2>The Impact of Your Donation</h2>
    <p>Your contribution towards our minivan is not just about helping us acquire a vehicle. It's about enabling us to continue our mission seamlessly as we transition back to the mainland. The minivan is more than just a vehicle. It is our means to access essential services, to be a part of the community, and most importantly, to keep us focused on our mission. Each trip to the grocery store, each drive to a doctor's appointment, each journey to engage with the community is made possible because of your generosity. Your support keeps us moving, literally and figuratively. Thank you!</p>
