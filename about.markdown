        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Hilary and Keith have always felt called to serve in the mission field. Hilary's passion was ignited when she read Marilyn Laslow's book on missions to Papua New Guinea. Keith, on the other hand, received his call at a youth conference in high school. But it was the transformative power of God's Word that specifically led him to End Bible Poverty Now (EBPN).</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: Keith and Genesis (10) love to play legos together, and have even dabbled in lego stop-motion movie making!</p>

        <h2>Our Work</h2>
        <p>Since joining EBPN, Hilary and Keith have passionately engaged in numerous initiatives. They have redesigned EBPN's website, published annual reports, and hosted a Bible Engagement training called Healing the Wounds of Trauma.</p>
        <p>They have co-led The Habakkuk Initiative, which is launching nation-wide Bible distribution initiatives around the world, with significant impacts in countries like Colombia and Guinea Bissau. In addition to these, they have developed courses for Youth With a Mission (YWAM) students to engage with the Bible, co-written curriculum for a Bible Distribution course in partnership with Renew World Outreach, and led small groups on marriage and personal finances for individuals in YWAM.</p>

        <h3>Translation</h3>
        <p>Their work has brought forth the joy of experiencing the Bible in local dialects, as evidenced by the recent translation of the first chapter of Ruth into a Fijian dialect. When the translator and back translator heard the story in their mother tongue for the first time, they were moved to tears. It was a revelational moment for all involved, giving a glimpse of the impact these translations will have in the nations.</p>

        <h3>Guinea Bissau</h3>
        <p>The hunger for the Word of God is unprecedented in Guinea Bissau. From police officers to vegetable sellers, everyone is asking for a Bible in their language! With the help of local churches and YWAM outreach teams, EBPN has significantly impacted the country. Over 14,431 Micro SD Cards have been distributed across all nine regions of the country. Through numerous Jesus Film showings, they have reached over 4,000 individuals, with 171 decisions to follow Jesus. The Lord is indeed moving in Guinea-Bissau.</p>

        <h3>Colombia</h3>
        <p>The transformative power of God's Word is evident in Colombia. One touching encounter was with a woman battling cancer. After receiving a Bible and being prayed for, her life changed dramatically. She found hope in the scriptures, started attending church, and has become an encouraging testimony in her community.</p>
