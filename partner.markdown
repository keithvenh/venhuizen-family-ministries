<h1 class="page-title">Expanding Our Mission</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Join us in transforming lives through the power of God's Word. Help meet our critical needs and sustain our mission.</p>
<p id='introduction'>Our mission to ensure access to the Bible and foster deeper engagement with God's Word is one that we passionately pursue every day. As self-funded missionaries, we rely on the generous support of individuals like you to keep our mission thriving. Here, we share our current fundraising goals that will help expand our mission.</p>

    <h2>Monthly Support</h2>
    <p>Our ongoing mission requires consistent, monthly support. These funds directly influence our ability to carry out our work and maintain a sustainable lifestyle. Our current monthly support goal is $6000. This will not only cover our living expenses but will also provide for ministry/business expenses, future educational needs, retirement savings, and allow us to focus more wholly on our ministry work. Crucially, this level of support will also facilitate our aspirations for foster care and adoption. Regular, reliable support allows us to create a stable and loving home environment for more children, while also freeing us to focus on the important work of transforming nations through engagement with God and His Word. With your monthly contribution, you're investing in a brighter future for individuals, communities, and nations.</p>

    <h2>One-Time Needs</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we face immediate, one-off needs that are integral to our ministry and daily lives. Your support for these projects means we can quickly move forward, meeting challenges head-on without delaying our work.</p>

        <h3>Minivan Fund</h3>
        <i class="section-icon fa fa-car"></i>
        <p>As we work in different locations, a reliable vehicle is essential for our family. The minivan is not just a tool for transportation; it is a conduit for our mission. It will ensure we can attend engagements, meetings, and safely take our children to school. Beyond this, the minivan plays a crucial role in our future goal of foster care and adoption. A spacious, dependable vehicle will allow us to welcome more children into our home and care for them as they deserve. Your generous contribution brings us closer to achieving this goal, aiding us in expanding our family and enabling us to continue transforming lives through our mission.</p>

        <h3>Moving Expenses</h3>
        <i class='section-icon fa fa-box-open'></i>
        <p>The call to serve extends beyond our work with EBPN; it permeates our personal lives and family vision as well. Our decision to move from Kona, Hawaii to Arizona aligns closely with our aspiration to provide foster care and adopt children. Arizona, with its supportive system for foster care and adoption, offers us a great opportunity to make this dream a reality. We've previously been accepted into Building Arizona Families, and we look forward to resuming this process once we're back in Arizona. To help facilitate this important move, we're seeking to raise between $5000 - $10000. These funds will cover the costs of transporting our belongings from our current location and those we have in storage in California. Your support in this area will not only ease our transition but also help set the stage for expanding our family in the future.</p>

        <h3>Remote-Work Technology</h3>
        <i class='section-icon fa fa-laptop'></i>
        <p>Our work with EBPN continues to evolve as we strive to meet the needs of the communities we serve. As a part of this growth, I am being asked to start and lead a new remote-work team. This exciting initiative requires me to have reliable technology that can handle our needs. The cost of upgrading our technology (including a MacBook Air, home office setup with monitor and Mac Mini, and an iPad for digital whiteboarding sessions) is estimated to be around $3000 - $5000. Having the right tools for this task is crucial in ensuring that our team can function efficiently and effectively. With your support, we'll be better equipped to fulfill this new role and expand the reach of EBPN's transformative work.</p>
